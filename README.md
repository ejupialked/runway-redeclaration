# Runway Re-declaration Tool - Team 9
The Runway re-declaration tool is usable by air traffic controllers at any UK airport to aid them in their re-declaration calculations. The tool provides them with a means for checking their calculated values as well as the calculations themselves. It should be noted the tool cannot fully replace the air traffic controllers as they are still required to carry out the calculations themselves in the interest of safety - it functions as a comparative to provide them with confidence in their mathematics and to help further ensure safety.
The tool is configurable to any UK airport and provides the functionality for multiple runways and obstacles present at each.

The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/ejupialked/runway-redeclaration/blob/master/User%20Documentation.pdf).
